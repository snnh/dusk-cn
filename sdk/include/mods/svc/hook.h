 * Hooks allow intercepting calls to game functions, allowing you to:
 * - Modify arguments
 * - Perform your own work before (pre), after (post) or instead of (replace) the original call
 * - From a pre hook, conditionally skip the original call and return your own value
 *
 * In most cases, you'll want to instead use the C++ helpers in mods/svc/hook.hpp
 * (mods::hook::add_pre/add_post/replace). They generate the trampoline passed to
 * install and provide compile-time type checking.
 *
 * resolve() resolves an address by symbol name for targets you can't name at compile time
 * (file-local statics included).
