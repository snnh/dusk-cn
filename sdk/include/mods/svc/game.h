 * The mod SDK imports this service automatically for mods built with FEATURES game; service-only
 * and asset-only mods do not require it.
 *
 * Major version is the game-code ABI epoch: it is bumped when game-visible struct or vtable layouts
 * change incompatibly (e.g. a TARGET_PC field added to an existing game struct). The loader's
 * ordinary version check then fails mods built against the old epoch with a clear message instead
 * of letting them corrupt memory.
